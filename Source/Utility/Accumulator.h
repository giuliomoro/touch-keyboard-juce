 * Accumulator
 *
 * Calculate the running sum of the last N points of a signal.  Unlike Integral, it does not
 * take into account the timestamps, and so is signficantly faster but less flexible.
 *
 * The output type of this class is a pair, the first of which indicates how many samples are
 * included in the accumulated result, and the second of which is the result itself.  This handles
 * transient startup conditions where all N samples are not yet available.
 *
