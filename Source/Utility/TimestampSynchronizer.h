/* TimestampSynchronizer
 *
 * We often want to deal with multiple independent data streams, roughly
 * synchronized in time to one another but operating on separate clocks.
 * Each data stream can be assumed to have a regular, constant frame interval
 * but the exact duration of the interval might not be known and might drift
 * with respect to the system clock.
 *
 * In this class, the self-reported frame number is compared to the current
 * system time.  In any multitasking OS, the system time when we receive a
 * frame may jitter around, but in the long-term average, we want system clock
 * and frame clock to stay in sync.  Thus we use the low-pass-filtered difference
 * between system clock and frame clock to adjust the reported frame rate, keeping
 * the two locked together.
